# My React Portfolio

## Description:

For this project I used ReactJS to rebuild my portfolio website. The site is a single page application including components for an About Me, Projects, Contact, and a downloadable resume. The page is styled with vanilla CSS and does not yet use any external packages aside from gh-pages.
